Ideas:

Agent is a state machine
-> State changes according to event & conditions
-> State defines a specific behavior (searching, hunting, fleeing)
-> State is updated periodically with new information -> or through event?
-> When a certain condition is met -> State change

Agent is a master class for the implementations (drone, animal, poacher)
